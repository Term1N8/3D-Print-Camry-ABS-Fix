A common issue with the 2007 Toyota Camry is the ABS module connection causing the entire CAN network to have communication issues. Symptoms include speedometer going to 0, ABS and brake lights on, and RPM arm fluctuating. Before replacing the entire ABS module, check if the culprit is a loose connection (which it commonly is). If so, this piece can help create pressure to maintain the connection.
